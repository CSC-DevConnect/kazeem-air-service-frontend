          Kazeem Air is committed to providing a website that is accessible to
          the widest possible audience, regardless of technology or ability. We
          are actively working to increase the accessibility and usability of
          our website and in doing so adhere to many of the available standards
          and guidelines. This ensures the site is flexible and adaptable to
          different users’ needs or preferences and is accessible through a
          variety of different technologies, including mobile devices or
          assistive technologies. This website endeavours to conform to level
          Double-A of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) These guidelines
          explain how to make web content more accessible for people with
          disabilities. Conformance with these guidelines will help make the web
          more user friendly for all people. This site has been built using code
          compliant with W3C standards for HTML and CSS. The site displays
          correctly in current browsers and using standards compliant HTML/CSS
          code means any future browsers will also display it correctly. Whilst
          Kazeem Air strive to adhere to the accepted guidelines and standards
          for accessibility and usability, it is not always possible to do so in
          all areas of the website. We are continually seeking out solutions
          that will bring all areas of the site up to the same level of overall
          web acessibility. In the meantime should you experience any difficulty
          in accessing the Kazeem Air website, please don’t hesitate to contact
          us.
